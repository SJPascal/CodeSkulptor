### this is a game created by a noob at programming, it was based off the Big Bang Theory show!!! the language is in python ###

import random

### this converts name into a number###

def name_to_number(name):
    if name == "rock":
        return 0
    elif name == "Spock":
        return 1
    elif name == "paper":
        return 2
    elif name == "lizard":
        return 3
    elif name == "scissors":
        return 4
    else:
        print
        
### this converts number to name###

def number_to_name(number):
    if number == 0:
        return "rock"
    elif number == 1:
        return "Spock"
    elif number == 2:
        return "paper"
    elif number == 3:
        return "lizard"
    elif number == 4:
        return "scissors"
    else:
        print

### this converts players choice to corresponding number###

def rpsls(player_choice):
    print
    print "Player chooses", player_choice + "!"
    player_number = name_to_number(player_choice)
    
### this converts computers random number choice with name###
    comp_number = random.randrange(0,5)
    computer_choice = number_to_name(comp_number)
    print "Computer chooses", computer_choice + "!"
### this computes the difference of both players number with modulo 5###
    difference = (comp_number - player_number) % 5
### this determines who the winner is###
    if difference == 0:
        return "There Is A Tie!!"
    elif difference == 1:
        return "Computer Wins!!"
    elif difference == 2:
        return "Computer Wins!!"
    elif difference == 3:
        return "Player Wins!!!"
    elif difference == 4: 
        return "Player Wins!!!"
    

    
### now play the game!!!###
### print what player chooses ###
print rpsls("rock")
print rpsls("Spock")
print rpsls("paper")
print rpsls("lizard")
print rpsls("scissors")
